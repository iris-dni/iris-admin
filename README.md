# Iris Admin UI

There are many topics that local communities regard as particularly pressing,
but journalists usually only discover them by accident. This problem inspired
our idea to create a platform where citizens’ concerns can be collected and
rated on a municipal level. That way a newspaper can create space for those
topics, host a discussion and bring additional value to the local community.
That is the goal of “Project Iris”.

The Admin UI is a browser-only web application that allows managing petitions
and users.
