# Auth


The default export of this module is a [higher-order component][hoc] that only
renders the wrapped component (i.e. the application) if the current user has
permissions to see the admin ui. This higher-order component also starts the
login process by redirecting unauthenticated users or users without the "admin"
permission to the login page.
